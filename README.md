# CurcuitPython Blink LED
# Description
My job was to make a code that told the circuit what colors to change to and a time gap in between those colors. It took lots of trial and erro and was easier on the second try. I was able to go slower and think about what i could be doing wroong, in the end this lead to my success>

# Servo 180
# Description
I coded my servo to turn 180 degrees. I was faced with the challkenge of figuring out ewhich degrees worked bgest and how to it not spin continusly. In the long run i was able to find the coirrect code and get my servo to spin 180 degress in intervoles.

# Distance Sensor
# Description
I needed to wire up the distance senor so it can track in cm. What i found diffcult about this was figuring out the right holes the wires needed to go into so it could work. If even one was off the whole thing would not work.

# Photo interupter 
# Description
In thid assighmnet i needed to make the photo interupter count how many times it was interupted with a prompt sentence on the screen. It was diffucult but i madfe it past the challenegs. The main diffucilty was figuring out if the problem resided in the physical board or the code itself. Luckilky i just got a different one and started over which led me to realize the problem was in the board.
