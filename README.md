#  Blink LED & code
# Reflection
My job was to make a code that told the circuit what colors to change to and a time gap in between those colors. It took lots of trial and erro and was easier on the second try. I was able to go slower and think about what i could be doing wroong, in the end this lead to my success>

# Reflection
I coded my servo to turn 180 degrees. I was faced with the challkenge of figuring out ewhich degrees worked bgest and how to it not spin continusly. In the long run i was able to find the coirrect code and get my servo to spin 180 degress in intervoles

# Reflection
Wiring up the distance sensor was diffucult at first but with reserche i was able to get it
Working with number is not easy and i learned the hard way that you have to be very paerticular with your code
Though at the end i was not able to get the blue LED to flash i still think i did a good job

# Reflection
I needed to count the interruptions and reflect that onto the serial monitor
I succeeded and the seiral counted the number or interruptions
This thought me to keeping trying even fater tyhings get hard

# Lcd Interuppteer
1) I was able to work through problmes my
2) When i did run into a problem i tried to fix it myself
3) I loved figuring out the kinks myslefg and having to think
